This project is a work in progress. For the first version, the only variables are mileage, minutes, and compensation per order. 
The goal for future versions is to add additional variables for calculation. I would like to add a field to input your vehicle's mile per gallon consumption, and another one
for the current gas price in your area.
In the future, I also want to take into account the location where the order will drop you off. For example, if the order has you ending up in a low traffic location, your overall
hourly rate would be affected negatively even though you might have made more money just for the one order compared to another order that would have dropped you off in a higher traffic
location, since you could have picked up another order more easily. 
In addition to higher and lower traffic locations, I also have the goal of taking into account your home address, and seeing how far the current order will take you from your home address. This would be particularly relevant if you are on your last order of the night, since you would have to account for the fact that you still need to drive home after completing the order.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
